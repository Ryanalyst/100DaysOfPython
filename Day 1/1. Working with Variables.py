# We can print characters to the screen with the print function. You need to include quotation marks surrounding what we want to print to the screen.
# print("Hello world!")

# We can also move to a new line and continue outputting to the new line by using \n. This is an escape character that tells the function it is not a part of the actual input
# print("Hello world!\nHello world~\nHello there!")

# By adding a + symbol between different strings we can concatenate or combine them into one output. But keep in mind that it does not add a space for you, you need to do that manually
#print("Hello " + "Ryan!")

# We can gather input from the user by using python's input function. We can then use their input in our code
fav_snack = input("What is your favorite snack: ")
print("You love " + fav_snack)
